# credit-risk-classification

Hello! This is the module 20 challenge for Rice University's Data Analytics bootcamp. In this assignment, we analyze credit risk data and used supervized machine learning to make predictions based on the data.

The primary code itself, as well as the csv file being referenced for this challenge, are both contained in the 'Credit Risk' folder. For best results, run the code in VS Code or in a python pandas-compatible software. The Credit-Risk-Analysis-Report file directly on the main branch contains a brief summary of the model's results, as well as a recommendation for the credit lending company.

The code contained in this repository is my work, and mine alone. 

Thank you!
