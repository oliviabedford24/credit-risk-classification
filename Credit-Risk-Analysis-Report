This challenge required us to train and evaluate a model based on credit risk. We used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to construct a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

- The accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the model were excellent. The model evaluated both high-risk loans and healthy loans, and gave scores for both.
- The accuracy of the model overall was 99% for both high risk and healthy loans.
- Precision refers to the percentage of correct predictions made by the model relative to all positive predictions. The precision of this model was 100% concerning healthy loans, and 86% concerning high risk loans.
- Recall refers to the percentage of correct positive predictions relative to the total number of actual positives. The recall of this model was 99% for both high risk and healthy loans.

This model shows itself to be both precise and accurate in identifying the creditworthiness of borrowers. The accuracy, precision, and recall values all scored higher than 80%, which indicates that this model is fit for regular use by the lending services company.
